# pandas-challenge

The **PyCitySchools** directory contains a Jupyter Source File which reads in 2 datasets (**schools_complete.csv** and **students_complete.csv**) from the Resources folder and uses Pandas library to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. 

Pandas library helps to create DataFrames which show school standardize tests performance based on different varibles (such as school type, school size, spending per students, etc.)
